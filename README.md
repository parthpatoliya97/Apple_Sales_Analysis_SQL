#### 1.Find the number of stores in each country
```sql
SELECT 
    country, 
    COUNT(store_id) AS total_stores
FROM store
GROUP BY country;
```

#### 2.Total number of units sold by each store
```sql
SELECT 
    s.store_id,
    st.store_name,
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_units
FROM store st
JOIN sales s ON st.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_id, st.store_name;
```

#### 3.Number of sales in December 2023
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS sales_in_december
FROM sales
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%m-%Y') = '12-2023';
```

#### 4.Stores with no warranty claim filed

#### Method 1: Using HAVING
```sql
SELECT

FROM store st
LEFT JOIN sales s ON st.store_id = s.store_id
LEFT JOIN warranty w ON s.sale_id = w.sale_id
GROUP BY st.store_id, st.store_name
HAVING COUNT(w.claim_id) = 0;
```

#### Method 2: Using NOT IN
```sql
SELECT 
    st.store_id,
    st.store_name
FROM store st
WHERE st.store_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.store_id
    FROM sales s
